# MudPy

It started with a desire to script in python for a mud I was playing. Python 3 wasn't supported, and other python implementations of mud clients didn't serve my needs.
 - main.py - the main file needed to run. currently all code is in this file, but it may be broken up in future. Star this repository for updates!




## Getting Started

Download the files in the main directory.
Windows:
run with python -m main.py

Linux/Mac/non-Windows:
run with python3 -m main.py

### Prerequisites

Python 3 (preferably 3.7 minimum)

any other requirements will be added in a file called requirements.txt
if no requirements file, then this runs using only standard libraries


### Installing

currently it's a matter of copy and paste.

## Running the tests

N/A as tests will be in a seperate repo.
TODO: link to repo with tests

## Deployment

see Installing

## Built With

Python 3.8!
